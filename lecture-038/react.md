# Intro to ReactJs

- [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)
- React is a library for building user interfaces, it is a declarative way of describing how the UI should look.
- For an MVC framework, React is the View (V).
- React was made by Facebook and is used by over 1.5 billion developers.

## Why React JS?

- The main feature of react is the virtual DOM.

## What is a Virtual DOM?

- Virtual DOM is a tree of nodes that represents the UI.
- In React when you change the state of the UI, the virtual DOM is updated and the UI is re-rendered specifically for the changed state.
- In React we use JSX to write the UI.
- JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript XML.

- React is component based, we have two ways to write components.
- One way is to use a class based component and the other is to use a function based component.

## What is a Component?

- A component is a self-contained unit of UI.
- A component is a class that has a render method, or a function that returns a virtual DOM.
- For example, a component that renders a button.
