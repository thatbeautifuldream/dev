# React.js

- To install/run the app (todo) you need to run the following command in your working directory:

```bash
npx create-react-app todo
```

## File Structure for React.js

- There are two folders public and src.
- The public folder is for static assets like images, css, and javascript.
- The files in the src folder are the source code for the app.

## Installation and usage

- After the `npx create-react-app` command is run, the app will be created in the current directory.
- cd into the app directory and run `npm start` to run the app.
- The app will be running on localhost:3000.
- The app will be served from the public folder.
- But any changes to the src folder will get reflected in the development server (auto-reload).

## Making our own Todo App

- The first step of making app was creating react app with the name todo.
- Now to get things started we need to create a folder called components and put our components (like: Todo.js) in there.
- As a convention, we will use PascalCase for component names.
- After deleting the default components, we will create our own components.
- We will create a Todo.js component.
